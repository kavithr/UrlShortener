# UrlShortener

The UrlShortener service takes a long url as an input and returns a short url.
It also returns the long url(actual url) when a short url is given as input.

This is a RESTful service built on ASP.NET Web API 2(C#)
and the unit and end-to-end tests have been written with the MS Test frameowrk.
